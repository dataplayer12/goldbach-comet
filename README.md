# Goldbach partition function G(x)

The Goldbach parition function G(x), defined for even numbers, is the number of ways in which an even number can be written as the sum of two primes

This project implements an efficient library to 
- calculate primes and
- calculate G(x) for any (even) x

# Goldbach comet

Tghe plot of G(x) famously looks like the tail of a comet and is called Goldbach comet. The present project reproduces the classic comet shape of this mathemtical object.
